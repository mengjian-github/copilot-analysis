# Your AI pair programmer
### **Get Code Suggestions in real-time, right in your IDE**

### **What’s GitHub Copilot**
GitHub Copilot provides autocomplete-style suggestions from an AI pair programmer as you code. You can receive suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do. 

### **Privacy**

Your code is yours. We follow responsible practices in accordance with our [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) to ensure that your code snippets will not be used as suggested code for other users of GitHub Copilot.

### **What can you do with GitHub Copilot?**
**Convert comments to code** <br />
GitHub Copilot uses a special version of GPT-3 that has been trained on a large body of public source code. It is as good at writing natural language as it is at writing code, so in fact it can complete your comments for you. In the example below, we first let it complete our explanation, and then, line by line, we tab through the code that does what we just said in English.

![comment-to-code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37570492/212965036-26579d9f-cfaf-44eb-90fb-76421dc7ab9d.gif)

**Create unit tests** <br />
An important use case of GitHub Copilot is to take some of the drudgery out of writing unit tests. Below, we already have an implementation of a function that computes the common prefix of two lists, and we want to test that. To do so, we import the unit test package, and then we start writing a test function to let Copilot generate the asserts which we accept just by hitting the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.

**Create a SQL query** <br />
What’s cooler than generating code in Go? Generating Go with embedded SQL! To make GitHub Copilot do that, just show it the schema as CREATE TABLE statements. And then, it nicely writes a query embedded in Go, converting the result to a Go class as you would have done yourself:

### **Powered by OpenAI**
It is powered by OpenAI Codex to work in real time, right from your editor. GitHub Copilot improves developer productivity and happiness by reducing disruptions, improving flow and increasing the amount of time a developer spends doing satisfying work. 

Unlike other code assistants, GitHub Copilot offers suggestions from a model that OpenAI built from billions of lines of open-source code. 

### **Supported languages, frameworks, and IDEs**
GitHub Copilot works on any language, including Java, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, C#, or C++. Because it’s been trained on languages in public repositories, it works for most popular languages, libraries and frameworks. It’s also integrated into your editor, and fast enough to use as you type.
